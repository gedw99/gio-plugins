# development

TODO...


Get all dependencies pulled in by the root make, so that anyone can build.

Get all the builds for Web, Desktop and Mobile running locally and in CI.
- https://github.com/gedw99/wasmvision/tree/main/.github/workflows

- use Makefile for both so its easy.

Get all CI builds publishing releases
- so then you can pull from laptops and test
- same with mobiles...
