# development

TODO...


1. Get all dependencies pulled in by the root make, so that anyone can build.

2. Get all the builds for Web, Desktop and Mobile running locally and in CI.
- https://github.com/gedw99/wasmvision/tree/main/.github/workflows

- use Makefile for both so its easy.

3. Get all CI builds publishing releases
- so then you can pull from laptops and test
- same with mobiles...
